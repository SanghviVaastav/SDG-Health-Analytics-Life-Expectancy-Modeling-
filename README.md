# SDG-Health-Analytics-Life-Expectancy-Modeling-
SDG-Health Analytics: Life Expectancy Modeling is a data science project that predicts life expectancy in developing countries using sanitation access and infant mortality data. The project applies data analysis and regression models to identify key health factors and support insights aligned with SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being.

This project predicts Life Expectancy in developing countries by analyzing the impact of sanitation access and infant mortality rates. Developed as part of the IIMSTC Internship, the study aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) to promote Good Health and Well-Being.

The core objective is to move beyond simple correlation and build a predictive framework that quantifies how infrastructure (sanitation) and early-life health outcomes (mortality) dictate population longevity
